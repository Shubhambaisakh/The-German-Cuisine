        <h2>Legal Bases</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Relevant legal bases under GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an
          overview of the legal bases of GDPR under which we process personal data.
          Please note that in addition to the GDPR regulations, national data
          protection requirements may apply in your country or our country of
          residence. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in
          individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> -
            The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal
            data for one or more specific purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> -
            Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
            pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
            interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
            freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany: </strong>In
          addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national
          regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes in
          particular the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains
          specific provisions on the right to information, the right to erasure,
          the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal
          data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as
          automated individual decision-making including profiling. Furthermore,
          state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
        </p>

        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance
          with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art,
          implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes
          of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the
          risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level
          of security appropriate to the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and
          electronic access to the data, as well as access to, input,
          transmission, securing availability, and their separation. Furthermore,
          we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject
          rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. We also
          consider the protection of personal data during the development and
          selection of hardware, software, and procedures according to the
          principle of data protection by design and default settings.
        </p>

        <h2>General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal
          requirements as soon as the underlying consents are withdrawn or other
          legal grounds for processing cease to exist. This applies to cases where
          the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no
          longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist when legal obligations or
          special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law
          reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection
          of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and
          deletion of data that specifically applies to certain processing
          operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When there are multiple specifications for the retention period or
          deletion deadline of data, the longest period always applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a period does not explicitly start on a specific date and is at least
          one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in
          which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing
          contractual relationships under which data is stored, the triggering
          event is the time when the termination or other end of the legal
          relationship becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data that is no longer needed for its original purpose but must be
          retained due to legal requirements or other reasons is processed
          exclusively for the reasons justifying its retention.
        </p>
        <p>

              (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on those provisions.
              Where personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing
              purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing
              of personal data concerning you for such marketing; this also applies

        </ul>

        <h2>Provision of Online Services and Web Hosting</h2>
        <p>
          We process the data of users to enable us to provide them with our
          online services. For this purpose, we process the IP address of the
          user, which is necessary to transmit the contents and functions of our
          online services to the browser or device of the user.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Types of processed data:</strong> Usage data (e.g., page
            views and session duration, click paths, usage intensity and frequency,
            used device types and operating systems, interactions with content and
            functions); Meta, communication and procedural data (e.g., IP addresses,
            time stamps, identification numbers, involved persons). Log data (e.g.,
            log files relating to logins or data retrieval or access times).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affected persons:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors,
            users of online services).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Provision of our online
            services and user-friendliness; Information technology infrastructure
            (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices
            (computers, servers etc.).). Security measures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retention and deletion:</strong> Deletion according to
            information in the section "General Information on Data Storage and
            Deletion".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)

          <strong>Additional information on processing procedures, processes and
            services:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Collection of access data and log files: </strong>Access to
            our online service is recorded in the form of "server log files". To
            these server log files may belong the address and name of the accessed
            web pages and files, retrieval date and time, transmitted data volumes,
            notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, user's
            operating system, referrer URL (the previously accessed page) and in
            general IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files
            can be used in the first place for security purposes, e.g., to avoid
            server overload (especially in the case of malicious attacks,
            referred to as DDoS attacks), and in the second place to ensure the
            server's load and stability;
            <span><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)
              GDPR()). </span><strong>Deletion of data:</strong> Log file
            information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or
            anonymized. Data whose further retention is required for proof purposes
            are excluded from deletion until the final clarification of the
            particular case.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files or other storage entries that store
          information on end devices and read them out. For example, to store the
          log-in status in a user account, a shopping cart in an online shop, the
          accessed contents or used functions of an online service. Cookies can
          also be used for different purposes, such as ensuring the functionality,
          security and comfort of online services as well as creating visitor
          flow analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information on consent: </strong>We use cookies in accordance
          with legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users
          unless the law requires otherwise. A consent is not necessary if the
          storage and reading out of information, i.e., also of cookies, is
          absolutely necessary for providing the user with a desired telemedia
          service (i.e., our online service) without exception. The revocable
          consent is communicated to the users and contains the information on the
          respective cookie use.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information on data protection legal bases: </strong>The
          legal basis for processing personal data of users with the help of
          cookies depends on whether we ask for consent. If the users accept, the
          legal basis for the use of their data is the given consent. Otherwise,
          the data processed with the help of cookies are processed on the basis
          of our legitimate interests (e.g., for the operation and improvement
          of our online service and the creation of anonymized visitor flow
          analyses) or, if this is necessary for the performance of our contractual
          obligations, to comply with our contractual obligations. We will clarify
          the purposes of the use of cookies in the course of this privacy policy
          or in the context of our consent and processing procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage duration: </strong>Cookies are distinguished by their
          storage duration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):</strong>
            Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest when a user leaves an
            online service and closes his device (e.g., browser or mobile
            application).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain even
            after the device is closed. For example, they can store the log-in
            status and display preferred contents when a user accesses a website
            again. Furthermore, the data obtained with the help of cookies can be
            used for visitor flow analyses. If we do not provide specific
            information on the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., in
            the context of obtaining consent), users should assume that these are
            permanent and their storage duration may be up to two years.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>General information on revocation and objection (Opt-out): </strong>Users
          can revoke and, at the same time, object to the processing in accordance
          with legal requirements, also by means of the privacy settings of their
          browser.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Types of processed data:</strong> Meta, communication and
            procedural data (e.g., IP addresses, time stamps, identification
            numbers, involved persons).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affected persons:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors,
            users of online services).

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Processing of cookie data on the basis of consent: </strong>We
            use a consent management solution, in which the consent of users for
            the use of cookies or for the methods and providers named in the
            context of the consent management solution is obtained. This method
            serves the obtaining, recording, management and revocation of
            consent, in particular for the use of cookies and similar technologies
            used for the storage, reading out and processing of information on
            the devices of users. In the context of this method, the consent of
            users for the use of cookies and the processing of information
            related to these, including the specific processing and providers
            named in the consent management process, is obtained. Users also have
            the opportunity to manage and revoke their consent. The consent
            declarations are stored to avoid repeated queries and to fulfill the
            proof requirements in accordance with legal requirements. Storage
            takes place server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called Opt-In cookie)
            or by means of comparable technologies, in order to associate the
            consent with a specific user or his device. If no specific information
            on the providers of consent management services is available, the
            following general information applies: The duration of storage of
            consent is up to two years. In this case, a pseudonymous user
            identifier is created, which is stored together with the consent date,
            the information on the scope of consent (e.g., relevant categories of
            cookies and/or service providers), and information about the browser,
            system and device used;
