          <strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br /><br />
          <strong>Liability for Content</strong><br /><br />
          The contents of our pages have been created with utmost care. However,
          we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
          content. As service providers, we are responsible for our own content
          on these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to
          10 TMG, however, we as service providers are not obligated to monitor
          transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
          circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
          block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However,
          liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of
          a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we
          will remove this content immediately.<br /><br />
          <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br /><br />
          Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, over whose
          content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
          for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
          linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages
          were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
          Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However,
          permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable
          without concrete evidence of a violation of law. If we become aware of
          any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br /><br />
          <strong>Copyright</strong><br /><br />
          The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
          subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution,
          and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require
          the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and
          copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.
          Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator,
          the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party
          content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
          copyright violation, please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware
          of any legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.<br /><br />
          <strong>Data Protection</strong><br /><br />
          The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal
          data. As far as personal data (for example name, address, or email
          addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary
          basis where possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties
          without your explicit consent.<br />
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when
          communicating by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete
          protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br />
          The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint
          obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and
          information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The site operators
          expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of
          unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as through spam
          emails.<br /><br /><br />

          This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by

          information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where
          such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google
          will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

          of the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called "web beacons" (small
